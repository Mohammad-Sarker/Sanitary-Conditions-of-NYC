<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<ul>
  <h4 text-align: center;>This project's theme is in the area of health/covid. My focus is whether or not rodent inspection rates show more infestations and if rooftop drinking water is less sanitary during the pandemic, which will quantitatively measure New York City's current sanitary conditions. Data Science assists my approach in researching this topic because there are numerous statistical tools that are necessary for developing significant insight like pandas for cleaning my data, matplotlib for visualizing it, and SQL for filtering. My datasets compile data entirely from NYC, and it relates to the city because this state has had downgrades regarding sanitary procedures in the last year. I'm analyzing trends that are exclusive to NYC that are relevant to the overall health of citizens.</h4>
</ul> 

<h3 text-align: center;>Work completed:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Cleaned both datasets for null or missing entries to decrease the size of the file.</li>
  <li>Discovered basic correlation in compliance vs bait rodent inspections, or other types to pinpoint the recurring necessity for routine checkups.</li>
  <li>Filtered rooftop drinking water data by different types of unsanitary conditions vs year to reveal statistical percentages for varying forms of contamination.</li>
  <li>Completed pie chart, bar graph, and scatter plot visualizations for both comparisons listed above.</li>
</ul> 

<h3 text-align: center;>Work planned:</h3>
<ul2>
  <li>I plan to create more visualizations to clearly show my results.</li>
  <li>I plan to analyze other columns in both datasets for potential relevant findings.</li>
  <li>I intend to compare both datasets by calculating the increase in negative sanitary conditions and then attempt to find similarities in the growth if any.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I will describe my research, in addition to whether or not I consider it a success.</li>
</ul2>
